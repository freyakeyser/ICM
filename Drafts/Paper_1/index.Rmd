abstract: |
  Marine fishes were once believed to be extremely resilient to the effects of fishing. However, this view has changed over time, partly due to the collapse and subsequent lack of recovery of several histically important stocks across the globe. This has raised questions about the underlying assumptions used in the management of these stocks and the impact of environmental factors on the population dynamics. Despite extensive research exploring these challenges, few studies have explored the underlying demographic variability of harvested marine fishes using conservation biology and population ecology perspectives. Here we reconstruted the demographics of 77 stocks that are assessed in the north Atlantic and the northeast Pacific Oceans using life-tables. This method allowed for the exploration of the demographic variability of these stocks using metrics commonly used in conservation biology (i.e., population growth rates, doubling time, lifetime reproductive success, and generation time).In general, these stocks had a latent capacity for population growth (median $\lambda$ = 1.1) when the effect of fishing was excluded. When the impacts of fishing were accounted for the stock mean $\lambda$ was 1.02 overall. However, $\lambda$ when accounting for fishing were less than one 57% of the time. As a result, for many of the stocks in this analysis, population growth is driven by years with exceptionally high population growth rates.  For most stocks, as abundance declined, $lambda$ tended to increase and become more variable. These general patterns are highly variable among stocks and regionally, with notable differences within Atlantic cod stocks in the northwest (NW) Atlantic. These stocks had few large recruitment events and evidence of positive density dependence (i.e., Allee effects or depensation) was relatively strong. The recovery potential was relatively high, with simulations indicating that 60 of the stocks would be highly likely to double in size within 20 years in the absence of fishing. Stocks with a low recovery potential were constrained to stocks with both a low median $\lambda$ and low variability in the $\lambda$. While most stocks exhibited a latent population growth capacity in the absence of fishing, regional and stock specific factors revealed that several stocks lacked this capacity, even in the absence of fishing. Knowledge of the underlying demographic parameters for a stock can be used to help sustainably manage the stock and can inform the development of rebuilding plans for stocks that have collapsed.  Finally, we note that life history characteristics alone were a poor predictor of annual population growth or future recovery potential, with greater variability observed among stocks rather than among species with distinct regions associated with generally higher or generally lower vital rates.
