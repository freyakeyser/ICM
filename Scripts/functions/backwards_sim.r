# The backwards simulation part of the ICM.sim function which we need for the first part of this work to see how well the model does at backwards projections of the stock

# All the data you need to make it dance...
# years:          The years you are running the backwards calculation for
# n.sims:         The number of simulations you are running
# mat.age         Age at maturity if one value it is the age at 50% maturity, if a vector it is the age at maturities for each age(or age/year), if a matrix we want this to be unique for each simulation
#                 we could also let this vary by year, but we'll need to go 3-D array or something for that# ages:           What are the ages you are using this is used to calculate max age, which may not be ideal with plus group stocks.

# nm:             Natural mortality, this wants the instantaneous natural mortality, not the proportional. There are several options here....
#                 You can enter a vector of instantaneous natural moralities, just put a single number of all ages, or put in a character
#                 string that will tell the function to calculate the natural mortality based on life history data. If a matrix the rows are different simulations
#                 we could also let this vary by year, but we'll need to go 3-D array or something for that

# sel             The selectivity of the stock.  Currently this is set up as a single number and it is tweaked in the code, we'll need to make this more complex.

# rems        Removals from the fishery in a given year.

# N               Population size in a given year

# u:              Exploitation rate (annual not instantaneous), currently set up to be 1 value.

# pop.model:      What method you going to use to get the population growth modeled for the backwards model.  You can use exponential model, logistic model, 
                  #or a dec.rate (decline rate) model.

# What we need for the Lotka.r function...
# fecund:      How are you estimating fecundity. If a vector it is the number of recruits produced by the average individual in the age classes. 
#              If a matrix the rows are different simulations. Also have options to set fecund = 'eggs' which we can use if we can get an estimate of egg mortality
#              fecund = 'SPR' uses the spawner per recruit metric, to get this to work we need to know how many recruits there are in a given year
#              We could also let this vary by year, but we'll need to go 3-D array or something for that
# mat.ogive.K 
# L.inf 
# K 
# t0 
# a.len.wgt 
# b.len.wgt 
# a.fec.len 

# w.age           The weight of individuals for each age, if a matrix the rows are different simulations
#                 we could also let this vary by year, but we'll need to go 3-D array or something for that
# K
# dec.rate
