# Here we take the ideas from the backwards projections but 'tune' them to the 'known' biomass by adjusting either the fecundity or survivorship variables iteratively until
# the biomass in the current year is withing X% of the actual biomass.

# All the data you need to make it dance...
# years:          The years you are running the backwards calculation for
# abund.ts:       The abundance time series from the assessment

# tuner:          What are we tuning, the fecundity "f", or natural mortality 'm', or both 'b'
# rems            Removals from the fishery in a given year.
# n.steps         The number of different m or f options to explore.  Make sure this is an even number!
# step.size:      How big is the difference (proportional) in the simulation step.  Default = 0.05 which is about a 5% change for each step
# mat.age         Age at maturity if one value it is the age at 50% maturity, if a vector it is the age at maturities for each age(or age/year), if a matrix we want this to be unique for each simulation
#                 we could also let this vary by year, but we'll need to go 3-D array or something for that# ages:           What are the ages you are using this is used to calculate max age, which may not be ideal with plus group stocks.

# nm:             Natural mortality, this wants the instantaneous natural mortality, not the proportional. There are several options here....
#                 You can enter a vector of instantaneous natural moralities, just put a single number of all ages, or put in a character
#                 string that will tell the function to calculate the natural mortality based on life history data. If a matrix the rows are different simulations
#                 we could also let this vary by year, but we'll need to go 3-D array or something for that

# sel             The selectivity of the stock.  Currently this is set up as a single number and it is tweaked in the code, we'll need to make this more complex.


# N               Population size in a given year

# u:              Exploitation rate (annual not instantaneous), currently set up to be 1 value.

# pop.model:      What method you going to use to get the population growth modeled for the backwards model.  You can use exponential model, logistic model, 
                  #or a dec.rate (decline rate) model.

# What we need for the Lotka.r function...
# fecund:      How are you estimating fecundity. If a vector it is the number of recruits produced by the average individual in the age classes. 
#              If a matrix the rows are different simulations. Also have options to set fecund = 'eggs' which we can use if we can get an estimate of egg mortality
#              fecund = 'SPR' uses the spawner per recruit metric, to get this to work we need to know how many recruits there are in a given year
#              We could also let this vary by year, but we'll need to go 3-D array or something for that
# mat.ogive.K 
# L.inf 
# K 
# t0 
# a.len.wgt 
# b.len.wgt 
# a.fec.len 

# w.age           The weight of individuals for each age, if a matrix the rows are different simulations
#                 we could also let this vary by year, but we'll need to go 3-D array or something for that
# K
# dec.rate
# direction       Allow for forwards and backwards simulations
