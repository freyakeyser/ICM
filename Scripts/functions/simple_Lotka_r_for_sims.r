# Function to calculate Lotka R, this is a simplified version of a more complex function (the more complex function allows for life history estimates of fecund and mort)
# In this case we are feeding it the mortality and fecundity directly, effectively for this function we know the components of the Leslie matrix and are just
# doing the optimization.
# This simulation one does a bit of constraint on the value of R so values are within what was observed in the originial data
# some fecundity/natural mortality combos can very rarely lead to bonkers growth or decline which we don't want.

# Function Arguments
#
# mort:     Mortality for each age class, you could use natural mortality (M) or total mortality (Z=F+M).  The function is expecting natural mortality to be instantaneous
# fecund:   Fecundity by age class, this is the average number of offspring produced by a female in an age class
# ages:     The ages vector, ideally this goes from 1 (or even 0) to the maximum age, should have same number of age classes as the mortality and fecundity vectors(matrices)
